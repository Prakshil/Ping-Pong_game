4. The game continues indefinitely - see how high you can score!

## Game Mechanics

- **Left Paddle (Player)**: Controlled by mouse movement
- **Right Paddle (AI)**: Automatically follows the ball with slight delay
- **Ball Physics**: 
  - Bounces off top and bottom walls
  - Changes vertical speed based on where it hits the paddle
  - Resets to center after each score
- **Scoring**: Point awarded when ball passes opponent's paddle
